    <h2> My Daily routine</h2>
    <p> start my day at 6 AM with a morning workout to energize myself.
         Afterward, I have a healthy breakfast that prepares me for the tasks ahead.
         I dedicate my morning hours to work or studies, taking short breaks to stay focused.
        Lunch is a pause to recharge and connect with family or friends. </p>
